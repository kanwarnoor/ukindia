            India’s vision to become a global education hub is underpinned by
            the <strong>India@2047 strategy</strong> — a 25-year roadmap
            launched alongside the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
            Structured into five-year phases, the plan sets out a bold
            trajectory for transformation:

            <li>
              <strong>Phase 1 (2022–2027):</strong> Establish foundational
              reforms, including regulatory clarity, institutional autonomy, and
              expanded international collaboration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 2 (2027–2032):</strong> Finalise partnerships,
              promote dual and joint degrees, and embed industry integration in
              curricula.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 3 (2032–2037):</strong> Strengthen India’s global
              education brand, encourage foreign campuses, and align higher
              education to future skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 4 (2037–2042):</strong> Deepen research ecosystems,
              regionalise excellence, and enhance faculty and infrastructure
              quality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase 5 (2042–2047):</strong> Cement India’s role as a
              global knowledge leader, exporting innovation, research, and
              educational models. For UK institutions, the time to engage with
              the education sector is now – to contribute meaningfully, build
              sustainable TNE models, and play a role in shaping India’s journey
              to 2047.
