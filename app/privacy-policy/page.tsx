          UK India Business Council Limited is based at Alliance House, 12
          Caxton Street, London , SW1H 0QS. We may be contacted via the website,
          but we are also on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. We have a company
          in India as well, but all data collated in the UK are processed on
          UK-based systems, even by the Indian –based company staff. We may
          process “personal data” and/or “special category data” (as defined in
          UK data protection legislation, including UK GDPR) as part of our
          contracted services, membership services and/or our administration.
          Data may also be transferred overseas as part of this processing in
          limited circumstances. All feasible security measures are in place. We
          realise the importance of confidentiality. Data are held as long as
          they remain pertinent to the reasons for collection and/or if there is
          a statutory retention period.
          <br />
          <br />
          Any data transferred outside the UK-based systems are processed in
          accordance with the extant Indian Data Protection legislation and
          procedures. All security measures are defined by the UK Company.
          <br />
          <br />
          Data may be shared with third parties as part of our contracted
          services and/or if we are required by law to do so. “Third parties”
          may include specialist contractors we may include in specific projects
          for members. We cannot accept any liability for any processing
          conducted by a third party outside our remit.
